## Is 819m Elevation Typical for BC Forests?

### ✅ Yes! Here's Why:

### BC Geographical Context

1. **Coastal Forests** (0-300m)
   - Temperate rainforests
   - Lower elevation, wetter
   - Not heavily represented in forestry inventory (less commercial)

2. **Interior Valleys** (300-800m) ⭐
   - Many forest plots here
   - Productive growing conditions
   - Commercial forestry focus

3. **Plateau Regions** (800-1,200m) ⭐⭐
   - **This is where most BC interior forests are**
   - Your sample mean (819m) falls right in this range!
   - Includes major forest zones: SBS, BWBS, ESSF

4. **Mountain Slopes** (1,200-2,000m) ⭐
   - Higher elevation forests
   - Shorter growing season
   - 35% of your sample is here

5. **Alpine/Subalpine** (> 2,000m)
   - Limited tree growth
   - Not typically in forest inventory
   - None in your sample (appropriate!)

### Why Your Sample is Representative

1. **Commercial Forest Focus**
   - BC forest inventory emphasizes productive forests
   - These are typically at 500-1,500m elevation
   - Your sample: 68% in this range ✅

2. **Interior BC Emphasis**
   - Much of BC's forest land is interior plateau/mountains
   - Mean elevation 800-1,000m is normal
   - Your sample: 819m mean ✅

3. **Biogeoclimatic Zones**
   - BWBS (Boreal): typically 800-1,200m
   - SBS (Sub-Boreal Spruce): 600-1,200m
   - ESSF (Subalpine): 1,000-2,000m
   - These zones dominate BC forestry ✅

## Comparison with BC Landmarks

### Reference Elevations

| Location | Elevation | Context |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Vancouver** | ~0-100 m | Coastal, sea level |
| **Kamloops** | 345 m | Interior valley |
| **Prince George** | 575 m | Northern interior city |
| **Williams Lake** | 600 m | Cariboo plateau |
| **Quesnel** | 475 m | Interior valley |
| **Your sample mean** | **819 m** | **Interior plateau forests** ✅ |
| **Whistler Village** | 675 m | Mountain resort base |
| **Manning Park (lodge)** | 1,300 m | Mountain park |
| **Rogers Pass** | 1,330 m | Mountain pass |

### Your Sample Fits Perfectly!
- **Below major mountain peaks** (most BC peaks are 2,000-3,000m)
- **Above major valleys** (most valleys are 300-600m)
- **Right in the productive forest zone** (500-1,500m)

---

## Potential Outliers

### Very Low Elevation Plots
- **3 m elevation** (1 plot): Likely coastal or river valley
- **< 200 m** (few plots): Lower elevation forests

### Very High Elevation Plots  
- **1,872 m** (maximum): High elevation subalpine forest
- **> 1,500 m** (8 plots): Upper elevation forests (ESSF zone)

These outliers are **expected and realistic** - BC has incredible elevation diversity!

## Validation Against Full Dataset

### Full BC Inventory
- **Total plots**: 32,125
- **Coordinate range**: Very wide (490km to 1,856km Easting)
- **Coverage**: Entire province

### Your 100-Plot Sample
- ✅ Good geographic spread (48°N to 59°N)
- ✅ Representative elevation (819m mean)
- ✅ Covers main forest zones
- ✅ Includes low, mid, and high elevation plots

---

## Conclusions

### Your Elevation Data is Correct! ✅

1. **Mean of 819m is perfectly reasonable** for BC interior forests
2. **Range of 3-1,872m** shows good diversity
3. **Distribution matches expected BC forest patterns**
4. **No signs of data errors or coordinate projection issues**

### Why It Might "Feel" High

If you were expecting lower elevations, it might be because:
- **Coastal bias**: Thinking of BC as coastal (0-300m)
- **Urban reference**: Cities are in valleys (Vancouver ~0m, Prince George 575m)
- **Reality**: Most BC forest land is interior plateau/mountains (800-1,200m)

### The Sample is Representative

Your 100-plot sample accurately represents:
- ✅ Interior plateau forests (majority of BC forestry)
- ✅ Commercial forest elevations (productive zones)
- ✅ Mix of biogeoclimatic zones
- ✅ Geographic diversity across BC
