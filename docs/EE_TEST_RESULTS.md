- Earth Engine: 5,000 requests/day
- 100 samples extracted: ~100 requests
- Full dataset (32,125): ~6-7 days with rate limits

### Storage Requirements
- 100 samples: ~33 KB CSV
- 32,125 samples: ~10 MB estimated
- Image patches (if downloaded): ~2 GB for full dataset

### Computational Requirements
- Preprocessing: Fast (<1 second for 100 samples)
- Training with satellite features: Similar to current baseline
- CNN training (if using patches): GPU recommended

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **The Earth Engine integration is working excellently!**

- 98% success rate for extractions
- High-quality satellite data obtained
- Successful merge with forest inventory
- Preprocessing pipeline validated
- Ready for model training

The integration of satellite imagery adds 5 new numerical features (NDVI, EVI, elevation, slope, aspect) that capture environmental conditions at each plot location. These features, combined with active/inactive site detection and temporal matching of imagery, should significantly improve model performance for predicting Pacific Yew density.
