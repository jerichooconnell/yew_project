## Performance Results

### Threshold Optimization
Decision threshold tuned to balance precision and recall:

| Threshold | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Accuracy |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **0.50** (default) | 0.0048 | 0.9000 | 0.0096 | 13.81% |
| **0.65** (optimized) | 0.0275 | 0.0500 | 0.0355 | 98.75% |

### Key Findings

#### Default Threshold (0.5):
- ‚úÖ **Excellent recall:** 90% of yew occurrences detected
- ‚ùå **Poor precision:** 99.5% false positive rate
- üìä Model is very aggressive in predicting yew presence

#### Optimized Threshold (0.65):
- ‚úÖ **Better precision:** 2.75% (5.7√ó improvement)
- ‚úÖ **High accuracy:** 98.75%
- ‚ùå **Low recall:** Only 5% (3 out of 60 yew plots detected)
- üìä Conservative predictions, missing most yew

### Trade-off Analysis
The extreme class imbalance (245:1) makes this a difficult prediction task:
- **Low threshold (0.5):** Finds yew but with many false alarms
- **High threshold (0.65):** Few false alarms but misses most yew

**Recommendation:** Use threshold 0.5-0.55 for yew detection/conservation work where finding all occurrences is critical. Use 0.65+ for high-confidence predictions only.

## Feature Importance Analysis

### Top 5 Most Important Features

#### By Permutation Importance (performance drop when shuffled):
1. **VHA_WSV_LS** (Volume): +0.000231 (forest productivity)
2. **NIR** (Near-Infrared): +0.000143 (vegetation health)
3. **NDVI**: +0.000045 (vegetation index)
4. **Elevation**: +0.000043 (terrain)
5. **Slope**: +0.000025 (terrain)

#### By Gradient Magnitude (model sensitivity):
1. **Blue band**: 0.004361 (highest gradients)
2. **Green band**: 0.003754
3. **Red band**: 0.002684
4. **BA_HA_LS** (Basal Area): 0.000975
5. **SI_M_TLSO** (Site Index): 0.000643

#### By Correlation with Target:
1. **Red band**: 0.0505 (strongest correlation)
2. **STEMS_HA_LS**: 0.0467
3. **Green band**: 0.0418
4. **Blue band**: 0.0376
5. **Slope**: 0.0325

### Feature Category Comparison

| Category | Count | Mean Importance | Total Importance |
|----------|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Satellite Features** (EE) | 9 | -0.000020 | -0.000180 |
| **Inventory Features** | 6 | -0.000112 | -0.000674 |

**Note:** Negative permutation importance suggests potential overfitting or that these features may be adding noise rather than signal for this extremely rare class.

### RGB Bands Analysis
- **High gradient importance:** Blue > Green > Red (ResNet uses these heavily)
- **Correlation:** Red > Green > Blue (red band most correlated with yew)
- **ResNet processing:** Model is actively using pretrained RGB channel weights
- **Transfer learning benefit:** ImageNet weights capture relevant spectral patterns

### Inventory Features
- **VHA_WSV_LS** (Volume): Most positive permutation importance
- **AGEB_TLSO** (Age): Most negative permutation importance (-0.000760)
- **SI_M_TLSO** (Site Index): Highest gradient among inventory features
- **Stand metrics** (BA, STEMS, VHA) show mixed importance

## Satellite vs Inventory Features

### ResNet Feature Extraction
- **Purpose:** Extract spatial patterns from satellite data
- **Strategy:** Treat 9 satellite features as 9-channel "image" (9√ó7√ó7 tensor)
- **Result:** ResNet processes these through pretrained convolutional filters
- **Finding:** RGB bands have highest gradients, suggesting active use of pretrained weights

### Feature Synergy
The hybrid architecture combines:
1. **Spatial patterns** from satellite data (via ResNet)
2. **Stand characteristics** from inventory (via tabular network)
3. **Categorical context** via embeddings (BEC zone, TSA, sample type)

## Challenges & Insights

### Extreme Class Imbalance
- **245:1 ratio** makes traditional metrics misleading
- **High accuracy** (98.75%) achieved by predicting "no yew" most of the time
- **F1 score** remains low even with aggressive class weighting
- **Focal Loss** helps but cannot fully overcome extreme rarity

### ResNet Transfer Learning
- **Frozen weights:** Using ImageNet features as-is (no fine-tuning)
- **Modified input:** 9 channels instead of 3 (RGB + NIR + indices + terrain)
- **Weight initialization:** Pretrained for RGB, Xavier for new channels
- **Trainable parameters:** Only 1.8% of total (206K / 11.4M)

### Feature Importance Interpretation
- **Low absolute values** reflect the extreme rarity of yew
- **Negative importance** may indicate overfitting or redundancy
- **Gradient analysis** shows which features the model is actively using
- **RGB dominance** suggests ResNet is leveraging pretrained spectral knowledge

## Recommendations

### For Model Improvement
1. **Gather more yew-present samples** - 234 total samples is very limited
2. **Try regression** instead of classification - predict density directly
3. **Ensemble approach** - combine multiple models with different thresholds
4. **Semi-supervised learning** - use unlabeled data to improve representations

### For Deployment
1. **Use threshold 0.5** for yew detection and conservation prioritization
2. **Use threshold 0.65+** for high-confidence presence confirmation
3. **Ensemble predictions** across multiple runs with different random seeds
4. **Consider probability scores** rather than binary predictions

### For Feature Engineering
1. **Keep RGB bands** - high gradient importance shows active use
2. **Consider removing age** (AGEB_TLSO) - negative importance
3. **Evaluate volume-based features** - VHA_WSV_LS shows promise
4. **Test alternative vegetation indices** beyond NDVI/EVI
